In this project, I looked at human resources data. My primary goal was to find trends that relate to employee termination. I cleaned the data and created additional variables to use for better exploratory data analysis; I created a data pipeline to transfer the cleaned data to a SQL relational database; I used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to conduct my EDA; and I ran the data through a SVC machine learning model to predict employee termination with an accuracy of 0.73%.
